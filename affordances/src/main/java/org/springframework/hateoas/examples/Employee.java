/**
 * Domain object representing a company employee. Project Lombok keeps actual code at a minimum. {@code @Data} -
 * Generates getters, setters, toString, hash, and equals functions {@code @Entity} - JPA annotation to flag this class
 * for DB persistence {@code @NoArgsConstructor} - Create a constructor with no args to support JPA
 * {@code @AllArgsConstructor} - Create a constructor with all args to support testing
 * {@code @JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknow=true)} When converting JSON to Java, ignore any unrecognized attributes.
 * This is critical for REST because it encourages adding new fields in later versions that won't break. It also allows
 * things like _links to be ignore as well, meaning HAL documents can be fetched and later posted to the server without
 * adjustment.
